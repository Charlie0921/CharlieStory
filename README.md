# Charlie’s Story (without Framework)

## Inspiration
- While researching how to become a developer, I noticed many websites focused heavily on developers’ average wages. I felt that focusing on financial aspects rather than passion was unhealthy when choosing a career.
- This website serves not only as a way to introduce myself to others but also as a personal motivation tool to keep me focused on my developer journey.
- It was created during my first development club experience and has been continually improved since then.

## What it Does
- This personal website functions as a digital portfolio, showcasing a brief introduction about myself, stories from my teenage years, and my current status.
- The stories highlight my passion for development by connecting past activities relevant to my goals.

## Challenges
- Building the website entirely from scratch without using any frameworks required a strong grasp of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Making the site responsive for both desktop and mobile meant redesigning font sizes, icons, and element positions carefully.
- For the ‘Teenage Years’ section, I wanted an interactive component that displays different content when different buttons are clicked.

## Resolution
- Used CSS media queries to ensure the site adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
- Created dynamic content components in the ‘Teenage Years’ section by toggling CSS classes via JavaScript event listeners, allowing content to update interactively based on user input.

## Accomplishments
- Successfully shared my website on social media, inspiring peers who are also preparing for developer roles by sharing my personal journey.

## What I Learned
- Gained deeper understanding and appreciation for native web technologies and how to leverage them effectively without relying on frameworks.
- Developed skills in responsive design and interactive UI components using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
