              <p>
                Kunjoong was just a Korean student with a passion for devices,
                often sharing his thoughts on his blog. One of his dreams was to
                make friends from divers background. However, he couldn't speak
                a single sentence in English. Suddenly, he moved to China and
                attend an international school for the first time, gradually
                became fluent in English. This is where his journey truly began.

              <h3>Middle School</h3>
              <p>
                When he got his first Android smartphone, he loved experimenting
                with different open-source firmware on his device. One day, he
                felt inspired to build an app and joined an after-school acvitiy
                called "App Developer. Alongside his interest in app
                development, he was passionate about environmental
                contributions. In the Habitat for Humanity club, he helped build
                a well in a community in China that desperately need a reliable
                water source.

                After moving back to Korea, he had to adapt to a new school
                environment but COVID pendamic hit. Despite the challenges of
                virtual communication, he returned to his blog to stay connected
                and continue shared his thoughts about new technology. He also
                dedicated an hour each week to teach English to elementary
                stduents from migrant families at the Seongnam Migrants Center.
                During the college appliacation process, he reflected on his
                past activites and wanted to choose a major that would allow him
                to use technology to address socital issues.That's why he
                decided to pursue Computer Science.

            continuously building on his software development skills. While he
            knows there's still a long journey ahead, his dream of becoming a
